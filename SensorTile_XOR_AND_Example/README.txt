***GETTING STARTED WITH SENSORTILE - XOR-AND System ***

This application executes on the SensorTile STM32 system.

This is a complete Embedded ML application demonstrating training and testing Embedded ML operation. This is an example illustrating a neural network trained to match the behavior of an XOR - AND gate network with three input states and two output states.

For those experienced with SensorTile and the STMicroelectronics Datalog project, this system can be implemented simply by replacing the Catalog main.c file with the main.c file in this repository directory.

Now, for those learning about SensorTile please see this information below on this new wireless sensor IoT platform and also Tutorial guidance:
