# EmbeddedML for the STM32 Platform
### Implementation of Embedded Machine Learning on the STM32 Platform

This repository is aimed at promoting development solely on the STM32 (or similar platforms) for other development paths see the core [EmbeddedML](https://github.com/merrick7/EmbeddedML) library. 

**EmbeddedML** was first created to be an alternative to the limited options available for Artificial Neural Networks in C. It is designed to be efficient without sacrificing ease of use. It is meant to support students as well as industry experts and it is built to be expandable and straightforward to manipulate.
