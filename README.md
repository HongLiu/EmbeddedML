# EmbeddedML for the STM32 Platform
### Implementation of Embedded Machine Learning on the STM32 Platform

This repository is aimed at promoting development solely on the STM32 (or similar platforms) for other development paths see the core EmbeddedML library. 

**EmbeddedML** was first created to be an alternative to the limited options available for Artificial Neural Networks in C. It is designed to be efficient without sacrificing ease of use. It is meant to support students as well as industry experts and it is built to be expandable and straightforward to manipulate.
  
## GETTING STARTED WITH SENSORTILE

### Examples
  - Learning Orientation Based on Accelerometer Data
      * [Video](https://youtu.be/phoKZ6RlKD0) of performance on STM's SensorTile 
  - Learning the XOR-AND Gate

The examples are complete Embedded ML applications demonstrating training and testing Embedded ML operation.

For those experienced with SensorTile and the STMicroelectronics Datalog project, the examples can be implemented simply by replacing the Catalog main.c file with the main.c file in the corresponding repository directory.

Now, for those **learning about SensorTile** please see this information below on this new wireless sensor IoT platform and also Tutorial guidance:
