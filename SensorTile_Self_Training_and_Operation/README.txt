***GETTING STARTED WITH SENSORTILE - SensorTile Self Training and Operation ***

This application executes on the SensorTile STM32 system.

This is a complete Embedded ML application where the SensorTile platform trains the neural network classifier that itself executes on the SensorTile.  This application initiates and guides training via access to the SensorTile over the standard USB-serial interface.  The application trains on actual orientation values then performs computation in real time of the device orientation.  This all occurs in a matter of seconds.

For those experienced with SensorTile and the STMicroelectronics Datalog project, this system can be implemented simply by replacing the Catalog main.c file with the main.c file in this repository directory.

As a demonstration of this system, please see this video:
