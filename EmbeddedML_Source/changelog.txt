Changelog:
	CORE:
		Fixed: Mistake in RELU2 definition
		
		Change: Renamed 'weak_softmax' to 'strong_softmax'
		Change: RELU now begins decreasing at 1.03 rather than 1.1
		Change: 'ANN.output' now returns network output rather than error. Allows for user to define error calculation.

		Addition: 'init_embedded_ann' --> Allows for a loaded ANN's bias and weights to not be modified.

		Optimization: Cut out excess looping in backprop and forwardprop. 

	DESIGNER:
		Change: 'Load ANN' option now uses the 'init_loaded_ann' function
		Change: 'Load ANN' option now declares "output" to replace "y" array
